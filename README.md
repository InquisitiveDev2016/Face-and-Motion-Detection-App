# Face-and-Motion-Detection-App
Facial and Motion Detection App using Python and OpenCv

Thanks to the tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkcUgPhOlP8, I got to dive and learn a little bit about Computer Vision and the OpenCV library by creating a facial and motion detection app. 


The facial detection app works by placing a green border with any front facing portrait (including the sample pic in the repo).

The motion detection app has some flaws in it due to the excessive noise that is also being contoured, however it does manage to track people's motion by placing a contour on the person as well.
